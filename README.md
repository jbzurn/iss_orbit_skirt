===============

2013 Space Apps challenge code: ISS Orbit Skirt. This project helps to show the orbit of the International Space Station (ISS) around our planet using a black skirt displaying an image of the earth. Using Lilypad Arduino and stitchable LED's, the flight will slowly light up around the skirt over a period of 91 min. until it reaches the approximate time when it is over our city (indicated by the light's presence over the Earth).
